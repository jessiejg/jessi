				<div class="text">My Creative Skills & Experience</div><p> From all of the things and experienced that I have done I think the top five is dancing, playing guitar, swimming, playing badminton, and drawing. I love dancing becuase I can enjoy all the movement of the dance that's why I feel really happy when I'm dancing. Other than dancing I also Like playing guitar because I can't live without music and I think the easiest instrument is guitar. For swimming, playing badminton and drawing I just take it as my hobby so I don't really take it seriously.</p>
